== Installation ==

1. Upload `wp-form-creator` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugin Panel' in WordPress
1. While in the WordPress admin panel, simply navigate to the Form Creator by clicking on the tab for "Settings".
1. Once you create a Form, you want to take the template tag generated and past it into your page or post where it will render.
1. Add CSS for the markup

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
1. It doesnt work with my theme. Now what?
*This has happened in some instances where the designer did not account for forms. Our Form Creator does NOT include CSS for styling the form because our intention was to make it inherit the design characteristics of the theme. This obviously will not work if the designer did not account for forms.
1. Why doesnt your form creator provide actual css markup for the forms?
*The output is fully XHTML compliant and rather than try to design a form with a generic output someone would have to edit, we opted instead to provide basic CSS on the project site to demonstrate the flexibility to the designer and blog owner.*
1. Will this work PayPal or other types of forms like Multi Page Forms?
*This version will not support PayPal or multi page forms, our subsequent releases however will!*
1. You mention that it saves data to the database, how can I see the saved data?
*This form generator is loosely based on the Form Kit that does have this support and we did not make it into this release but we promise it is being added.*
1. Will this work in WordPress Multi User?
*Yes, tested briefly during development we encountered no major issues.*
1. *Are there any special settings I should be aware of?*
*Yes the forms output although XHTML will not have any styling to it by default unless the theme supports this but the way around this is to view the examples on our blog for more details*
1. Are there any linkback requirements?
*There is one linkback in the actual rendered form and you are free to remove it by simply donating to the project. It will help fund all the features we have pending now.*
1. Can I distribute this plugin with my themes (commercial or gpl)?
*Yes, I have some code that will assist you in doing this so distribution will be much easier for your projects.*
